# S-DeepONet-transient-predictions
An improved sequential DeepONet model implementation that uses a recurrent neural network (GRU) in the branch and a feed-forward neural network in the trunk. It can predict the full field solutions at multiple time steps given a time-dependent input function and the domain.

The DeepONet implementation and training is based on DeepXDE:
